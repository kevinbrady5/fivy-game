<p>The goal of Fivy is to get rid of all your cards before the end of each round and have the lowest score after the final round.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fivy is played in <i>rounds</i> and each round has <i>5 turns</i></li>
    <li>The game starts with 5 face down cards lined up in the middle of the table, these are the <i>turn cards</i></li>
    <li>Each player is dealt 5 cards and the remaining cards create a face down <i>draw pile</i></li>
    <li>At the start of each turn, the corresponding turn card is turned face up</li>
    <li>You get rid of your cards by playing them when it is your turn</li>
    <li>You play cards by adding them on to the face up <i>turn cards</i>
    <li>You can add cards to count up or down on any face up turn card <i>if they are the same suit</i></li>
    <li> Or you can play a card of any suit on a face up turn card if they have <i>matching values</i></li>
    <li>A player's turn begins by drawing 1 card from the draw pile</li>
    <li>The player can then play any number of cards until they have no playable cards left</li>
    <li>This ends the player's turn and play continues with the next player</li>
    <li>Each turn has a random <i>wild card</i> that lasts for that turn only</li>
    <li>The wild card is like a blank slate that can be played on any face up card and then followed by any card the player chooses</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of gameplay:</p>
<p>The game is setup by shuffling the deck, laying down the 5 face down turn cards, dealing 5 cards to each player, and placing the remaining cards face down as a draw pile</p>
<ol>
    <li>The 1st turn begins by turning over the 1st turn card and noting the wild card for this turn</li>
    <li>The 1st player draws 1 card and plays any playable cards in their hand</li>
    <li>Then the next player does the same until the last player has gone, then the 1st turn is over</li>
    <li>The 2nd turn begins by turning over the 2nd turn card and following the turn instructions</li>
    <li>Play continues the same as the 1st turn except now the players have 2 turn cards to play on and there is a different wild card</li>
    <li>Play continues like this until the end of the 5th turn, then the round is finished</li>
    <li>After each round, the score is updated with the number of remaining cards in a player's hand</li>
    <li>After the final round, the game is over!</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other special rules to note...</p>
<ul>
    <li>During a player's turn, if there is only one face up turn card in a pile, they can play it on another face up turn card where applicable. This creates a free space to play any card the player chooses</li>
    <li>Even if a player gets rid of all their cards before the end of the round, play will continue allowing the other players the remaining turns to try to get rid of their cards</li>
</ul>
