<h2>How To Play</h2>
</div>
<div class="modal-body">
<p>The goal of Fivey is to get rid of all your cards before the end of the round.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fivey is played in <i>rounds</i></li>
    <li>Each round has <i>5 turns</i></li>
    <li>The game starts with 5 face down cards lined up in the middle of the table, these are the <i>turn cards</i></li>
    <li>Each player is dealt 5 cards</li>
    <li>The remaining cards create a face down <i>draw pile</i></li>
    <li>At the start of each turn, the corresponding turn card is turned face up</li>
    <li>You get rid of your cards by playing them when it is your turn</li>
    <li>You play cards by adding them on to the face up <i>turn cards</i>
    <li>You can add cards to count up or down on any face up turn card <i>if they are the same suit</i></li>
    <li> Or you can play a card of any suit on a face up turn card if they have <i>matching values</i></li>
    <li>A player's turn begins by drawing 1 card from the draw pile</li>
    <li>The player can then play any number of cards until they have no playable cards left</li>
    <li>This ends the player's turn and play continues with the next player</li>
    <li>Each turn has a random <i>turn modifier</i></li>
    <li>The turn modifier will give instructions that all players follow before the turn starts <i>or</i> it will specify a modifier that lasts for that turn only</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of gameplay:</p>
<p>The game is setup by shuffling the deck, laying down the 5 face down turn cards, dealing 5 cards to each player, and placing the remaining cards face down as a draw pile</p>
<ol>
    <li>The 1st turn begins by turning over the 1st turn card and following the turn modifier instructions</li>
    <li>The 1st player draws 1 card and plays any playable cards in their hand</li>
    <li>Then the next player does the same</li>
    <li>After the last player's turn, the 1st turn is over</li>
    <li>The 2nd turn begins by turning over the 2nd turn card and following the turn instructions</li>
    <li>Play continues the same as the 1st turn except now the players have 2 turn cards to play on and a different turn modififer</li>
    <li>Play continues like this until the end of the 5th turn, then the round is finished</li>
    <li>After each round, the score is updated</li>
    <li>After the final round, the game is over!</li>
</ol>
<p>Some other special rules to note...</p>
<ul>
    <li>During a player's turn, if there is only one face up turn card in a pile, they can play it on another face up turn card where applicable. This creates a free space to play any card the player chooses</li>
    <li>Even if a player gets rid of all their cards before the end of the round, they can still be dealt back in by a turn modifier that instructs all players to draw cards or pass cards to another player</li>
</ul>
